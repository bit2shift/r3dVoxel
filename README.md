r3dVoxel
========

A voxel game engine. Uses shader-based ray tracing

####Milestones to achieve
- *Finish the basic game engine behavior (Vulkan window, etc.)*
- *Define the way 'blocks' (16x16x16 voxels) are sent to Vulkan (maybe a streaming thread)*
- *Work out a shader to ray-trace the voxels in blocks (including GPU storage)*
- *Implement the client-server protocol (with packets for a custom usage)*
- *Figure out how to use OpenAL?*
- *__Considering other possible milestones__, make something useful with the engine*
